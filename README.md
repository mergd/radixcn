# radixcn

A UI component library that combines [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)'s API with [Radix Themes](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes)' design system.

## Status: Work in Progress ⚠️

This library is currently under active development and should be used in conjunction with shadcn components. Not all components have been ported yet.

## Overview

radixcn (Radix + shadcn) provides a set of components that:
- Maintain API compatibility with shadcn/ui
- Leverage Radix Themes' robust design system and tokens
- Reduce Tailwind dependencies
- Offer extensible variants mapped to Radix's built-in options

## Why radixcn?

While shadcn/ui offers an excellent API and documentation, and Radix Themes provides a strong design token system, each has its trade-offs:

- **shadcn/ui**: Great API, extensive component library, but heavy Tailwind dependency
- **Radix Themes**: Strong design system, but limited component coverage

radixcn bridges this gap by combining the best of both worlds.
