I am refactoring shadcn/ui to Radix theme components (@radix-ui/themes), with an eye on API compatibility.
- Cut down on the amount of tailwind.
- Keep variant API compatibility
- Map to Radix's built-in variants
- Handle sizes with `"1" | "2" | "3"` if needed
- Make variants extensible
- Use `Omit` for clean types
- Add `@deprecated` comments for any components that are deprecated
- Prefer Radix Icons over Lucide Icons
- Try to create thin wrappers around Radix Theme instead of reimplementing components â€“ and usually there's a radix themes version of the component.
