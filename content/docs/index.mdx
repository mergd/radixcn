This is a UI library built on top of [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes) (hence the name `radixcn`).


The `shadcn` API is extremely successful, well documented.
However, the design tokens is not very strong. On the other hand, the `radix-themes` design tokens and language are very strong, but given how it's only a subset of the `shadcn` API, it's hard to mix and match.


This library attempts to fix that, by using the api of shadcn but the components from radix themes.
